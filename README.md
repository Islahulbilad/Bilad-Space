# Bilad-Space

Project Name: Bilad Space
Developer: Islahul Bilad, S.Pd


Is a simulation of flying, landing and uniting a rocket with the space station (ISS). Made with full physics calculations, namely related to resultant force, centrifugal force, gravity and rocket engine thrust force. And the size uses a scale of 1 pixel: 1 meter.


Installation :
1. Make sure you have installed XAMPP
2. Extract bilad_space.zip and move the folder to C://Program Files/XAMPP/Htdocs (for XAMPP users)

Use :
1. Open a browser, type localhost/bilad_space/iss_mission.php
2. Rocket simulation can be used, click the launch button to fly the rocket
3. At an altitude of 100 km, click the separate button to separate stage 1 and stage 2
4. Adjust the throttle to get horizontal (Hspeed) and vertical (VSpeed) speed as well as the rocket angle to land stage 1 perfectly
5. If the stage 1 rocket has landed, click Change Camera to focus the camera on stage 1
6. Adjust the stage 2 throttle to obtain an accurate vertical speed (VSpeed) for reconciling with the ISS. The ISS will be visible if the altitude has reached 398.99 Km
7. Good luck
